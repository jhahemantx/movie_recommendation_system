# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using machine learning techniques and basic NLP tools. It suggests movies to users based on their past interactions. The model is trained using a dataset containing movie details, user ratings, and other relevant information.

## Features
- Content-based filtering using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization
- Hybrid recommendation approach combining both techniques
- Interactive web interface for user-friendly recommendations
- Efficient retrieval using a precomputed similarity matrix


## Model Details
The recommendation system is based on:
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies with similar descriptions.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for personalized recommendations.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines both techniques to improve accuracy.

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting user preferences.
- Successfully deployed a web app for interactive movie recommendations.
- Compared different recommendation techniques and fine-tuned hyperparameters.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate deep learning-based recommendation models.
- Include user reviews and sentiment analysis.
- Improve scalability using distributed computing techniques.
